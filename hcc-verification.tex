Having established the soundness of our translation, it is time 
we see in this section how we can use this sound translation to verify a program. 
The following theorem is then true:

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]\label{thm:prover-soundness}
Assume that $e$ and $\Ct$ contain only function symbols from $P$ and no free term variables.
Let $\Th_{all} = \Th\;\land\;\ptrans{}{P}$. 
If $\Th_{all} \land \neg\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$ is unsatisfiable 
then $\langle D_\infty,{\cal I}\rangle \models \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$ and 
consequently $\dbrace{e} \in \dbrace{\Ct}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
If there is no model for this formula then its negation must be valid (true in all models), that 
is $ \neg \Th_{all} \lor \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$ is valid. By completeness
of first-order logic $\Th_{all} |- \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$. This means 
that all models of $\Th_{all}$ validate $\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{f \in \Ct}$. In particular, 
for the denotational model we have that $\langle D_\infty,{\cal I}\rangle \models \Th_{all}$ 
and hence $\langle D_\infty,{\cal I} \rangle \models \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$. 
Theorem~\ref{thm:den-contr-satisfaction} finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

Hence, to verify a program $e$ satisfies a contract $\Ct$ we need to do the following:
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Generate formulae for the theory $\Th\;\land\;\ptrans{}{P}$
  \item Generate the negation of a contract translation: $\neg\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{e \in \Ct}$
  \item Ask a FOL theorem prover for a model for the conjunction of the above formulae
\end{itemize*}

\paragraph{Incremental verification}

Theorem~\ref{thm:prover-soundness} gives us a way to check that an expression satisfies a 
contract. Assume that we are given a program $P$ with a function $f \in dom(P)$, for which 
we have already shown that $\langle D_\infty,{\cal I}\rangle \models \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{f \in \Ct_f}$.
Suppose next that we are presented with a ``next'' goal, to prove that 
$\langle D_\infty,{\cal I}\rangle \models \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{h \in \Ct_h}$. 
We may consider the following variations of how to do this:

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Ask for the unsatisfiability of: 
    \[  \Th\; \land \; \ptrans{\Sigma}{P} \; \land \;\neg\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{h \in \Ct_h} \]
        The soundness of this query follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:prover-soundness} above.

  \item Ask for the unsatisfiability of:
    \[  \Th \; \land\; \ptrans{\Sigma}{P} \; \land \; \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{f \in \Ct_f} \land \neg \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{h \in \Ct_h} \]
        This query adds the {\em already proven} contract for $f$ to the theory. If this formula
        is unsatisfiable, then its negation is valid, and we know that the denotational model is 
        a model of the theory {\em and} of $\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{f \in \Ct_f}$ and hence it must also
        be a model of $\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{h \in \Ct_h}$.
  \item Ask for the unsatisfiability of:
    \[  \Th \; \land \; 
        \ptrans{\Sigma}{P \setminus f} \; \land \; 
        \ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{f \in \Ct_f} \; \land \;
        \neg\ctrans{\Sigma}{P}{h \in \Ct_h} \]
        This query removes the axioms associated with the \emph{definition} of $f$, leaving
        only its \emph{contract} available.  This makes the proof of $h$'s contract
        insensitive to changes in $f$'s implementation.
        Via a similar reasoning as before, such an invocation 
        is sound as well.
\end{itemize*}

Icremental verification essentially implies that our approach does not require a 
whole-program analysis: once a contract is proved about a function, it can be assumed, 
even if the definition of the function is not exported, and subsequently used to prove
contracts of other functions that may call it. Exporting only the contract but not a 
definition of a function can be beneficial for efficiency reasons when verifying further
goals; the drawback is that the exported contracts might not be precise enough for proving
these further goals. Our framework supports any of those strategies.


%% Our final goal is going to show that a program does not crash, that
%% is the final contract will be of the form $e \in \Ct$ where $\Ct$ is
%% going to be some {\em base contract}. Note that by base contract adequacy
%% (Lemma~\ref{lem:base-contract-adequacy}) if we manage to show a base contract 
%% denotationally, then the contract holds in operational terms.
