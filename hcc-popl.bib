                 programming language equipped with recursive,
                 higher-order functions, algebraic data types, and a
                 polymorphic type system in the style of Hindley and
                 Milner. It is the theoretical basis for a tool that
                 extracts proof obligations out of programs annotated
                 with logical assertions. These proof obligations,
                 expressed in a typed, higher-order logic, are
                 discharged using off-the-shelf automated or interactive
                 theorem provers. Although the technical apparatus that
                 we exploit is by now standard, its application to
                 functional programming languages appears to be new, and
                 (we claim) deserves attention. As a sample application,
                 we check the partial correctness of a balanced binary
                 search tree implementation.}
