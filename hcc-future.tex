% Integers
% SMT 2.0
% Printing countermodels
% (Typeclasses)
For the implementation, we would like to add support for primitive
data types, such as @Integer@. There exists theorem provers, such as
@T-SPASS@, that can deal with the @tff@ extension of typed first order
arithmetic problems of TPTP. Futhermore, supporting the SMT 2.0 input
format that for instance z3 supports would enable us not only to use
its input format for integers, but also use its mechanism for triggers
that corresponds quite exactly to the min predicate. A way of
presenting countermodels given by @paradox@ in an understandable way
for the user would be helpful.
