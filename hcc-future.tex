% Integers

There are several avenues for future work. 
In terms of our implementation, we would like 
to add support for primitive data types, such as @Integer@, using 
theorem provers such as @T-SPASS@ to deal with the @tff@ (typed first-order arithmetic)
extension TPTP. Another way is to also 
generate theories in the SMT 2.0 format, understood by Z3, which has support 
for integer arithmetic and more. As mentioned in Section~\ref{ssect:countersat} 
we have ideas how to generate finite counter examples for contracts that do not 
hold, and how they should be presented to the user. It would also be interesting 
to see if \emph{triggers} in SMT 2.0 could also be used to support that goal. 
Another important direction is finding ways to split our big verification goals
into smaller ones that can be proven significantly faster. Finally, we would like
to investigate whether we can automatically strengthen contracts to be used as 
induction hypotheses in inductive proofs, deriving information from failed attempts.

%A way of presenting countermodels given by @paradox@ in an easily
%understandable way for the user would be helpful.
