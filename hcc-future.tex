% Integers

% Printing countermodels
% (Typeclasses)
For the implementation, we would like to add support for primitive
data types, such as @Integer@. There exists theorem provers, such as
@T-SPASS@, that can deal with the @tff@ extension of typed first order
arithmetic problems of TPTP. Another way is to also generate theories
in the SMT 2.0 format, understood by Z3, which has support for
integer arithmetic and more.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{ssect:countersat} we have ideas how to
generate finite counter examples for contracts that do not hold,
and it would be interesting to see if triggers in SMT 2.0 could be used.
%A way of presenting countermodels given by @paradox@ in an easily
%understandable way for the user would be helpful.
