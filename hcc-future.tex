Static verification for functional programming languages seems an
under-studied (compared to the imperative world) and very 
promising area of research.
In practical terms, our most immediate goal is to
ensure that we can find finite counter-examples quickly,
and present them comprehensibly to the user, rather allowing the
theorem prover to diverge.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{ssect:countersat} we have well-developed ideas
for how to do this.  It would also be interesting 
to see if \emph{triggers} in SMT 2.0 could also be used to support that goal. 

We would like to add support for primitive data types, such as
@Integer@, using theorem provers such as @T-SPASS@ to deal with the
@tff@ (typed first-order arithmetic) part of TPTP. Another approach might be to
generate theories in the SMT 2.0 format, understood by Z3, which
has support for integer arithmetic and more.  Another important
direction is finding ways to split our big verification goals into
smaller ones that can be proven significantly faster. Finally, we
would like to investigate whether we can automatically strengthen
contracts to be used as induction hypotheses in inductive proofs,
deriving information from failed attempts.

%A way of presenting countermodels given by @paradox@ in an easily
%understandable way for the user would be helpful.
