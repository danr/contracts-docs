%% \subsection{Induction}\label{sect:induction}

An important practical extension is the ability to prove contracts about recursive functions
using induction. For instance, we might want to prove that @length@ satisfies $\CF -> \CF$.
\begin{code}
length [] = Z 
length (x:xs) = S (length xs)
\end{code}
In the second case we need to show that the result of @length xs@ is crash-free but we do not 
have this information so the proof gets stuck, often resulting in the sat-solver looping. 

A naive approach would be to perform induction over the list argument of @length@ -- however
in Haskell datatypes may be lazy infinite streams and ordinary induction is not necessarily 
a valid proof principle. Fortunately, we can still appeal to {\em fixpoint induction}. The 
fixpoint induction sheme that we use for @length@ above would be to {\em assume} that the 
contract holds for the occurence some function @length_rec@ inside the body of its definition, 
and then try to prove it for the function:
\begin{code}
length [] = Z 
length (x:xs) = S (length_rec xs)
\end{code}

Formally, our induction scheme is:
\begin{definition}[Induction sheme]\label{def:induction}
To prove that $\dbrace{g} \in \dbrace{\Ct}$ for a function $g\;\as\;\ol{x:\tau} = e[g]$ (meaning $e$ contains
some occurences of $g$) we perform the following steps:
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Generate function symbols $g^{\circ}$, $g^{\bullet}$, and formula $\ctrans{}{}{g^{\circ} \in \Ct}$.
  \item Generate the theory formulas \[ \phi = \Th \land \ptrans{}{P \cup g^{\bullet}\;\as\;\ol{x:\tau}} = e[g^{\circ}] \] 
  \item Prove that the query $\phi \land \ctrans{}{}{g^{\circ} \in \Ct} \land \neg \ctrans{}{}{g^{\bullet} \in \Ct}$
        is unsatisfiable.
\end{itemize*}
%% If it is unsatisfiable then $\dbrace{f} \in \dbrace{\Ct}$.
\end{definition}

Why is this approach sound? The crucial step here is the fact that contracts are admissible predicates.
\begin{theorem}[Contract admissibility]
If $d_i \in \dbrace{\Ct}$ for all elements of a chain $d_1 \sqcup \ldots$ then the limit of the chain 
$\sqcup d \in \dbrace{\Ct}$. Moreover, $\bot \in \dbrace{\Ct}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For the $\CF$ case we get the result from Lemma~\ref{lem:cf-admissible}. 
For the predicate case we get the result from the fact that the denotations of programs 
are continuous in $D_{\infty}$. The arrow case follows from induction.
\end{proof}

We can then prove the soundness of our induction scheme.
\begin{theorem} The induction scheme in Definition~\ref{def:induction} is correct. \end{theorem}
\begin{proof} We need to show that: 
$\dbrace{P}^{\infty}(g) \in \dbrace{\Ct}$ and hence, by admissibility it is enough to find
a chain whose limit is $\dbrace{P}^{\infty}(g)$ and such that every element is in $\dbrace{\Ct}$.
Let us consider the chain $\dbrace{P}^{k}(g)$ so that $\dbrace{P}^0(g) = \bot$ and 
$\dbrace{P}^{k+1}(g) = \dbrace{P}_{(\dbrace{P}^{k})}(g)$ whose limit is $\dbrace{P}^{\infty}(g)$. We 
know that $\bot \in \dbrace{\Ct}$ so, by using contract admissiblity, all we need to show is
that if $\dbrace{P}^{k}(g) \in \dbrace{\Ct}$ then $\dbrace{P}^{k+1}(g) \in \dbrace{\Ct}$. 

To show this, we can assume a model where the denotational interpretatino ${\cal I}$ has been 
extended so that ${\cal I}(g^{\circ}) = \dbrace{P}^{k}(g)$ and ${\cal I}(g^{\bullet}) = \dbrace{P}^{k+1}(g)$.
By proving that the formula 
\[ \phi \land \ctrans{}{}{g^{\circ} \in \Ct} \land \neg \ctrans{}{}{g^{\bullet} \in \Ct} \] 
is unsatisfiable, since $\langle D_{\infty},{\cal I}\rangle \models \phi$ and 
$\langle D_{\infty},{\cal I}\rangle \models \ctrans{}{}{g^{\circ} \in \Ct}$, we learn 
that $\langle D_{\infty},{\cal I}\rangle \models \ctrans{}{}{g^{\bullet} \in \Ct}$, 
and hence $\dbrace{P}^{k+1}(g) \in \dbrace{\Ct}$.
\end{proof} 

In many practical cases a straightforward generalization of our lemma above for mutually recursive definitions
is required and indeed our tool performs mutual fixpoint induction. We leave it as future work to develop
more advanced techniques such as strengthening of induction hypotheses or trying more sophisticated induction 
schemes~\cite{dan's master thesis??} \dv{Check!}
